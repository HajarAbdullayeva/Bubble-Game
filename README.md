# Bubble Game
Bubble game - https://hajarabdullayeva.github.io/bubble-game/

There are three modes in this game (easy, medium, and challenging ways). When you click the start button, bubbles appear on the board. If you click bubble, it bursts.
There is no win case. But if the count of bubbles on the board rich to 50, you lose the game.
